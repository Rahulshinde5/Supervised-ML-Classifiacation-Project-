# Project Title and Description
Health Insurance Cross-Selling Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aimed to predict customer responses for health insurance cross-selling. The analysis involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of insights.

## Data Source and Description
The dataset was obtained from AlmaBetter, containing information about customer attributes and whether they purchased the insurance policy.

## Methods Used
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Imbalanced data handling
- Visualization

## Code and Notebooks
Access the [Colab notebook](Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell_Prediction_Classification_Rahul.ipynb) to view the detailed project implementation.
